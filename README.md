## Building the Book

The book can be built into a PDF by using [Band Practice](https://github.com/andrewroycarter/Band-Practice)

## Contributing

**To add a new song:**

* Create a new file in the `songs` directory with a named after the song's title (`song.txt`)
* Format your song to fit nicely on one page (don't repeat chorus, leave out comments, etc), and format chords as `[G]`, `[A]`, etc.
* Add an entry for your song in `book.json`
* For more detailed instructions see [Band Practice](https://github.com/andrewroycarter/Band-Practice)'s README
* Create a Pull Request and if we like your song we'll do it to it.
