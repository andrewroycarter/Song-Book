[Intro]
|[[Gm] [Eb]| ... |[C] [D]||

[Verse 1]
 [G]          [Em]
 I, I gotta new life,
            [C]          [D]                [G]
 You would hardly recognize me, I'm so glad
              [Em]     [C]       [D]            [G]
 How could a person like me care for you?
          [Em]            [C]             [D]           [G]
 Why do I bother when you're not the one for me?
      [Am]      [D]
 Ooh, Ooh, Ooh

 Is enough enough?

[Chorus]
 [G]          [Em]          [C]            [D]               [G]
 I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes, I saw the sign
           [Em]       [C]           [D]
 Life is demanding without understanding
 [G]          [Em]          [C]            [D]                [G]
 I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes, I saw the sign
               [Em]                  [C]                    [D]         [C]
 No ones gonna drag you up to get into the light where you belong
      [D]
 But where do you belong? - Repeat Intro

[Verse 2] Same as verse 1
  [G]          [Em]
  Under the pale moon
         [C]            [D]              [G]
  For so many years I wonder who you are
              [Em]     [C]        [D]          [G]
  How could a person like you bring me joy?
            [Em]              [C]       [D]           [G]
  Under the pale moon where I see a lot of stars
       [Am]      [D]
  Ooh, Ooh, Ooh
  Is enough enough?  - [C]horus, then repeat intro

[Verse 3]  A bit different then the first 2, but same chords still.
 [G]          [Em]         [C]                [D]
 I saw the sign and it opened up my mind
          [G]                    [Em]
 And I am happy now living without you
      [C]          [D]
 I've left you, oh, oh, oh,oh
 [G]         [Em]           [C]            [D]                  [G]
 I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes, I saw the sign
                [Em]                 [C]                    [D]
 No ones gonna drag you out to get into the light where you belong
 [G]          [Em]
 I saw the sign
    [C]         [D]
 I saw the sign
 [G]          [Em]
 I saw the sign
        [C]            [D]               [G]
 And it opened up my eyes I saw the sign
