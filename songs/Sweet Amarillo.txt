[Verse 1]

[G]                         [D]            [C]            [G]
Well the worlds greatest wonder from what I can tell
[G]                     [D]              [C]       [G]
Is how a cowgirl like you could ever look my way
[G]               [D]              [C]            [G]
I was blinded by glory with a half written story
[G]                [D]            [C]
and song spillin out off of every page

[Chorus]

[G]          [D]     [C]            [G]
Sweet Amarillo, Tears on my pillow
[G]          [D]        [C]            [G]
You never will know how much I cried
[G]         [D]            [C]            [G]
Sweet [Am]arillo, like a wind in the willow
[G]             [D]          [C]            [G]
[D]amn this old cowboy for my foolish pride

[Verse 2]

[G]               [D]              [C]        [G]
So I drifted on down from the Iron Ore range
[G]               [D]                  [C]            [G]
[C]aught the wide Missouri where the cool waters flow
[G]             [D]          [C]              [G]
When I got to Topeka, I looked up your name
[G]                      [D]            [C]
but they said you rode off with the last rodeo

[Chorus]

[Bridge]

[C]
Well the thunders are rumblin
and the tumbleweeds tumblin
         [D]
and the rodeo clowns are paintin their face
     [Am]
I'm gunnin the throttle for Llano Estacado
      [C]                 [D]
on a wild appaloosa I?m blowing your way

Instrumental Verse

[Verse 3]

[G]               [D]               [C]            [G]
[D]own in old [Am]arillo theres a light in the window
[G]                   [D]             [C]        [G]
where a road weary shadow drifts into the arms
[G]                  [D]               [C]             [G]
of a long distance lover then they turn back the covers
[G]             [D]               [C]
and dance the Redova till the light of the dawn


[Chorus]

[G] [D] [C] [G]
Sweeeeeet Amarillo
[G] [D] [C] [G]
Sweeeeeet Amarillo
