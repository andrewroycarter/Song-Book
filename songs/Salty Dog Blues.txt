[G] Standin on the corner with the [E7] low down blues
[A7] Great big hole in the bottom of my shoes
[D] Honey let me be your Salty Dog.

CHORUS
[G] Let me be your [E7] Salty Dog
Or [A7] I won't be your man at all
[D] Honey let me be your Salty Dog.

[G] Listen here Sal, well [E7] I know you
[A7] Run down stockin' and a worn out shoe
[D] Honey let me be your Salty Dog.

chorus

[G] Down in the wildwood [E7] sitting on a log
[A7] Finger on the trigger and eye on the hog
[D] Honey let me be your Salty Dog.

chorus

[G] Pulled the trigger and [E7] they said go
[A7] Shot fell over in Mexico
[D] Honey let me be you Salty Dog.

chorus
