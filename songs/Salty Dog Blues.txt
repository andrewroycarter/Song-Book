[G] Standin on the corner with the low down blues
[A] Great big hole in the bottom of my shoes
[D] Honey let me be your Salty Dog.

CHORUS
[G] Let me be your [E]Salty Dog
Or [A]I won't be your man at all
[D] Honey let me be your Salty Dog.

[G] Listen here Sal, well I know you
[A] Run down stockin' and a worn out shoe
[D] Honey let me be your Salty Dog.

chorus

[G] Down in the wildwood sitting on a log
[A] Finger on the trigger and eye on the hog
[D] Honey let me be your Salty Dog.

chorus

[G] Pulled the trigger and they said go
[A] Shot fell over in Mexico
[D] Honey let me be you Salty Dog.

chorus
