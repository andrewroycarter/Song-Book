I hear the train acoming it's rolling round the bend
                                                 [G7]
and I ain't seen the sunshine sine I don't know when
    [C]                                              [G]
I'm stuck at Folsom Prison and time keeps draggin' on
         [D7]                                    [G]
But that train keeps rollin' on down to San Antone

When I was just a baby my Mama told me 'Son
                                           [G7]
always be a good boy; don't ever play with guns.
      [C]                                       [G]
But I shot the man in Reno, just to watch him die
       [D7]                                           [G]
when I hear that whistle blowin' I hang my head and cry

I hear the train a coming it's rolling round the bend
                                           [G7]
And I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when
      [C]                                       [G]
I'm stuck at Folsom Prison and time keeps dragging on
       [D7]                                           [G]
But that train keeps rolling on down to San Antone

When I was just a baby my mama told me Son
                                           [G7]
Always be a good boy don't ever play with guns
      [C]                                       [G]
But I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die
       [D7]                                           [G]
When I hear that whistle blowing I hang my head and cry

I bet there's rich folks eating in a fancy dining car
                                           [G7]
They're probably drinking coffee and smoking big cigars
      [C]                                       [G]
But I know I had it coming I know I can't be free
       [D7]                                           [G]
But those people keep a moving and that's what tortures me

[E]
Well if they freed me from this prison  if that railroad train was mine
                                           [G7]
I bet I'd move on over a little farther down the line
      [C]                                       [G]
Far from Folsom Prison that's where I want to stay
       [D7]                                           [G]
And I'd let that lonesome whistle blow my blues away
