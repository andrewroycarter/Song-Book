[Verse]

[Bb]                  [Bb]
   I took a pill in Ibiza
        [F]
To show Avicii I was cool
[D#]
And when I finally got sober, felt 10 years older
    [Bb]
But fuck it, it was something to do.

[Bb]
I'm livin' out in LA
[F]
I drive a sports car just to prove
[Bb]
I'm a real big baller
[D#]                                    [F]                     [Bb]
Cause I made a million dollars and I spent it on girls and shoes


[Chorus]

                         [Gm]
But you don't want to be high like me
                     [F]
Never really knowing why like me
                     [D#]                                            [Bb]
You don't ever wanna step off that roller coaster and be all alone.
                         [Gm]
You never wanna ride the bus like this
                     [F]
Never knowing who to trust like this
                   [D#]
You don't wanna be stuck up on that stage singing.
[D#]
Stuck up on that stage singing.
[Bb]      [F]          [D#]          [Bb]
All I know are sad songs, sad songs.
         [Bb]    [F]            [D#]         [Bb]
Darling, all I know are sad songs, sad songs.


[Verse]

           [Bb]         [F]
I'm just a singer who already blew his shot
      [D#]
I get along with old timers
                                [Bb]
Cause my name's a reminder of a pop song people forgot
                   [Bb]
And I can't keep a girl, no
         [F]
Cause as soon as the sun comes up
  [D#]                             [Bb]
I cut em all loose and work's my excuse

But the truth is I can't open up


[Chorus]

                         [Gm]
But you don't want to be high like me
                     [F]
Never really knowing why like me
                     [D#]                                            [Bb]
You don't ever wanna step off that roller coaster and be all alone.
                         [Gm]
You never wanna ride the bus like this
                     [F]
Never knowing who to trust like this
                   [D#]
You don't wanna be stuck up on that stage singing.
[D#]
Stuck up on that stage singing.
[Bb]      [F]          [D#]          [Bb]
All I know are sad songs, sad songs.
         [Bb]    [F]            [D#]         [Bb]
Darling, all I know are sad songs, sad songs.

[Bridge]

[Bb] - [F] - [D#]

[Verse]

                     [Bb]
I took a plane to my home town
             [F]
I brought my pride and my guitar
       [D#]                   [Bb]
All my friends are all gone but there's manicured lawns

And the people still think I'm a star
                [Bb]
I walked around downtown
           [F]
I met some fans in life I earned
          [D#]
They said tell us how to make it cause we're getting real impatient
                      [Bb]
So I looked em in the eye and said


[Chorus]
