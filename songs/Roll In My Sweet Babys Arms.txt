[G]
I ain't gonna work on the railroad
                        [D7]
Ain't gonna work on the farm
[G]
Lay around the shack
         [C]
Till the mail train comes back
    [D7]                      [G]
And roll in my sweet baby's arms


Roll in my sweet baby's arms
                        [D7]
Roll in my sweet baby's arms
[G]
Lay round the shack
         [C]
Till the mail train comes back
    [D7]                      [G]
And roll in my sweet baby's arms


Now where were you last Friday night
                     [D7]
While I was lying in jail
[G]                   [C]
Walking the streets with another man
[D7]                  [G]
Wouldn't even go my bail

repeat #2

I know your parents don't like me
                            [D7]
They turn me away from your door
[G]              [C]
Had my life to live over
[D7]                    [G]
Wouldn't go there any more

repeat #2
