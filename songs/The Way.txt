[Verse]

[Em]
They made up their minds
                  [Am]
And they started packing
       [B7]                                    [Em]
They left before the sun came up that day
       [E7]                          [Am]
An exit to eternal summer slacking
[Em]                         [B7]
But where were they going without ever
                [Em]
Knowing the way?

[Em]
They drank up the wine
                [Am]
And they got to talking
[B7]                                    [Em]
They now had more important things to say
[E7]                                    [Am]
When the car broke down they started walking
[Em]                         [B7]
Where were they going without even
                [Em]      [D]
Knowing the way?


[[C]horus]

                     [G]
Anyone can see the road that they walk on
         [D]
Is paved with gold
[Em]
It's always summer
              [B7]
They'll never get cold
              [C]
They'll never get hungry
              [G]             [D]
They'll never get old and grey
                   [G]                    [D]
You can see their shadows wandering off somewhere
         [Em]
They won't make it home
         [B7]
But they really don't care
         [C]
They wanted the highway
              [G]            [D]      [B7]
They're happier there today


[Verse]

[Em]
Their children woke up
                    [Am]
And they couldn't find them
        [B7]                         [Em]
They left before the sun came up that day
        [E7]                                 [Am]
They just drove off and left it all behind'em
[Em]                        [B7]
But where were they going without ever

                [Em]      [D]
Knowing the way?
