Wish that I was on old Rocky Top down in the Tennessee hills
                [C]        [G]         [Em]       [D7]        [G]
Ain't no smoggy smoke on Rocky Top ain't no telephone bills
             [C]      [G]         [Em]            [D7]         [G]
Once I had a man on Rocky Top half bear the other half cat
          [C]        [G]        [Em]               [D7]          [G]
Wild as a mink but sweet as soda pop I still dream about that

[Em]               [D7]        [F]                  [C]
Rocky Top you'll always be home sweet home to me

Once two strangers climbed old Rocky Top looking for a moonshine still
                [C]              [G]         [Em]            [D7]    [G]
Strangers ain't come down from Rocky Top I reckon they never will
                   [C]      [G]             [Em]         [D7]       [G]
Corn won't grow at all on Rocky Top the dirt's too rocky by far
                   [C]        [G]             [Em]         [F7]     [G]
That's why all the folks on Rocky Top get their corn from a jar

[Em]               [D7]        [F]                  [C]
Rocky Top you'll always be home sweet home to me

I've had years of cramped up city life trapped like a duck in a pen
              [C]      [G]         [Em]       [D7]      [G]
All I know is it's a pity life can't be simple again
