[G]                           [C]
I stopped at a roadhouse in Texas
  [G]                             [D7]
A little place called Hamburger Dan's
  [G]                        [C]
I heard that old jukebox a-playing
  [D7]                            [G]
A song called the Truck Driving man

                       [C]
Pour me another cup of coffee
    [G]                     [D7]
For it is the best in the land
     [G]                   [C]
I'll put a nickel in the jukebox
    [D7]                     [G]
And play the truck driving man

                                  [C]
The waitress then brought me some coffee
  [G]                          [D7]
I thanked her but called her again
  [G]                            [C]
I said that old song sure does fit me
[D7]                        [G]
'Cause I'm a truck driving man

                             [C]
I climbed back aboard my old semi
    [G]                       [D7]
And then like a flash I was gone
  [G]                           [C]
I got them old truck wheels a-rolling
       [D7]            [G]
I'm on my way to San Antone
