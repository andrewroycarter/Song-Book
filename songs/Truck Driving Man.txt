[G]                         [C]
I stopped at a roadhouse in Texas
[G]                             [D]
A little place called Hamburger Dan's
[G]                        [C]
I heard that old jukebox a-playin'
[G]               [D]             [G]
A song called the Truck Drivin' man

	[G]                             [C]
The waitress then brought me some coffee
[G]                           [D]
I thanked her but called her again
[G]                            [C]
I said that old song sure does fit me
		 [G]     [D]             [G]
'Cause I'm a truck drivin' man


Chorus:
[G]                       [C]
Pour me another cup of coffee
	[G]                      [D]
For it is the best in the land
	 [G]                   [C]
I'll put a nickel in the jukebox
	[G]        [D]             [G]
And play the truck drivin' man


[G]                          [C]
I climbed back aboard my old semi
	[G]                       [D]
And then like a flash I was gone
[G]                           [C]
I got them old truck wheels a-rollin'
[G]         [D]            [G]
I'm on my way to San Antone


Chorus
