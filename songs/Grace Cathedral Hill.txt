[Verse 1]

[G]                          [Em]
Grace Cathedral hill, all wrapped in the
                            [C]
bones of a setting sun, all dust and stone
                          [D]
and moribund. I paid twenty five cents to
          [D7]                 [G]
light a little white candle for a New Year's
      [Em]
Day. I sat and watched it burn away then
[C]
turned and weaved through the slow decay.
         [D]                          [D7]
We were both a little hungry so we went
                  [G]                               [Em]
to get a hotdog.  Down the Hyde St. Pier, the light was slight and
                     [C]                             [D]
dissapeared.  The air, it sunk of fish and beer. We heard
                             [D7]
a superman trumpet play the National Anthem.


[Chorus]

[C]                  [G]          [Em]   [C]
And the world may belong for you, but he'll
        [G]       [Em]   [C]                 [Cm]
never belong to you. But on a motorbike, when
                    [D]                 [D7]
all the city lights blind your eyes tonight, are you
         [C]          [D]                   [G]                  [Em]
feeling better now? .......Are you feeling be...ttttter..nooooww.
           [C]                 [Cm]
Are you feeling better now?


[Verse 2]
(same as verse 1)

Some way to greet the year: your eyes all
bright and brimmed with tears. The
pilgrims, pills and tourist here all sing
"Fifty three bucks to buy a brand new halo."
I'm sweet on a green eyed girl, all fiery
Irish clip and curl, all brine and piss and
vinegar. I paid twenty five vents to light a little white candle.

[Chorus]

[Coda]

[G] [Em] [C] [Cm]
La..la...la...la...
