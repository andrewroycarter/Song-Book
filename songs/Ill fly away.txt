[VERSE 1]

[G]                   [G7]                     [C]        [G]
Some glad morning when this life is o'er, I'll fly away
[G]            [Em]                    [G]     [D]7   [G]
To a home on [G]od's celestial shore, I'll fly away


[CHORUS]

[G]                 [G7]     [C]        [G]
I'll fly away, O glory, I'll fly away
[G]            [Em]                    [G]     [D]7   [G]
When I die, hallelujah, by and by I'll fly away


[VERSE 2]

[G]                 [G7]                       [C]        [G]
When the shadows of this life have grown, I'll fly away
[G]            [Em]                    [G]     [D]7   [G]
Like a bird from prison bars has flown, I'll fly away

[VERSE 3]

[G]                [G7]                    [C]        [G]
Just a few more weary days, and then, I'll fly away
[G]            [Em]                    [G]     [D]7   [G]
To a land where joys shall never end, I'll fly away
