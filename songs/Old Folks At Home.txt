[G]                     [C]                [G]
Well I wonder how the old folks are at home
                                  [C]
I wonder if they miss me when I'm gone
                              [G]             [E7]
I wonder if they pray for the girl who went away
    [A7]                           [D7]
And left her dear old parents so alone

    [G]                       [C]             [G]
Now you can hear the cattle lowing in the lane
                                             [C]
You can see the fields of blue grass where I roam
                                     [G]               [E7]
You can almost hear them cry as they kiss their girl goodbye
  [A7]             [D7]               [G]
I wonder how the old folks are at home

                     [C]                [G]
Just a village and a homestead on the farm
                                           [C]
And a mother's love to shield you from all harm
                             [G]                     [E7]
The sky is bright and blue a sweetheart that loves you
     [A7]                               [[D7]]
Just a village and a homestead on the farm

                            [C]             [G]
Now you can hear the cattle lowing in the lane
                                             [C]

                                     [G]               [E7]
You can almost hear them cry as they kiss their girl goodbye
  [A7]             [D7]               [G]
I wonder how the old folks are at home
