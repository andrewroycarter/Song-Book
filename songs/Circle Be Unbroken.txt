      [G]              [G7]
I was standing by my window
     [C]               [G]
On a cold and cloudy day
                           [Em]
When I saw the hearse come rolling
       [G]        [D7]      [G]
For to carry my mother away.

         [G]           [G7]
Will the circle be unbroken?
       [C]               [G]
By and by Lord, by and by
                      [Em]
There's a better home awaiting
       [G]         [D7]     [G]
In the sky Lord, in the sky.

             [G]                   [G7]
Well, I went back home, home was lonely
       [C]              [G]
For my mother she was gone
                            [Em]
And all my family there was cryin'
        [G]         [D7]       [G]
For our home felt sad and alone.

         [G]           [[G]7]
Will the circle be unbroken?
       [C]               [G]
By and by Lord, by and by
                      [Em]
There's a better home awaiting
       [G]         [D7]     [G]
In the sky Lord, in the sky.

     [G]           [G7]
Undertaker, undertaker
          [C]            [G]
Won't you please drive slow
                      [Em]
For that lady you are haulin'
        [G]       [D7]      [G]
Lord, I hate to see her go.

         [G]           [G7]
Will the circle be unbroken?
       [C]               [G]
By and by Lord, by and by
                      [Em]
There's a better home awaiting
       [G]         [D7]     [G]
In the sky Lord, in the sky.
