[G]        [B]         [C]          [G]
It's been ten long years since I left my home
[D]
In the holler where I was born
[G]         [B]              [C]          [G]
Where the cool fall nights make the wood smoke rise
[D]        [G]
And the fox hunter blows his horn

[G]       [B]          [C]             [G]
I fell in love with a girl from the town
[D]
I thought that she would be true
[G]    [B]      [C]        [G]
I ran away to Charlottesville
[D]           [G]
And worked in a sawmill or two

[D]                        [G]
CHORUS:  What have they done to the old home place?
[A7]                  [D7]
Why did they tear it down?
[G]        [B]        [C]          [G]
And why did I leave my plow in the field?
[D]          [G]
And look for a job in the town?


repeat INTRO

[G]       [B]        [C]       [G]
Well, the girl ran off with somebody else
[D]
The tariffs took all my pay
[G]       [B]            [C]          [G]
And here I stand where the old home stood
[D]        [G]
Before they took it away

[G]         [B]            [C]          [G]
Now the geese fly south and the cold wind blows
[D]
As I stand here and hang my head
[G]       [B]         [C]       [G]
I've lost my love, I've lost my home
[D]               [G]
And now I wish that I was dead

CHORUS
