[Intro]

[G] [D] [Em] [C]

[G]                             [D]
 Seems like everybody's got a price.
[D]                          [Em]
I wonder how they sleep at night
[Em]                               [C]
When the sale comes first and the truth comes second just stop for a minute
   [G]
and smile
                    [D]
Why is everybody so serious?
              [Em]
Acting so damn mysterious [G]ot your shades on your eyes
   [C]                                             [G]
And your heels so high That you can't even have a good time


[Pre-Chorus]

[G]                      [D]
Everybody look to their left (Yeah)
[D]                      [Em]
Everybody look to their right
[Em]
Can you feel that? (yeah)
[C]
We'll pay them with love tonight


[Chorus]

                  [G]
It's not about the money, money, money
                 [D]
We dont need your money, money, money
                      [Em]
We just wanna make the world dance
            [C]
Forget about the Price Tag
                 [G]
Ain't about the (uh) Cha-Ching Cha-Ching
                 [D]
Ain't about the (yeah) Ba-Bling Ba-Bling
                 [Em]
Wanna make the world dance
               [C]
Forget about the Price Tag


[Verse 2]

[G]                           [D]
 We need to take it back in time
                      [Em]
When music made us all unite
                            [C]
And it wasn't low blows and video hoes
                  [G]
Am I the only one gettin tired?
                    [D]
Why is everybody so obsessed?
                   [Em]
Money can't buy us happiness
                      [C]                                         [G]
Can we all slow down, enjoy right now Guarantee we'll be feelin alright

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[G]
Money, money, money
[D]
Money, money, money
[Em]

[C]
Forget about the Price Tag
              [G]
Ain't about the uh Cha-Ching Cha-Ching
               [D]
Ain't about the yeah Ba-Bling Ba-Bling
               [Em]
Wanna make the world dance
                [C]
Forget about the Price tag.
