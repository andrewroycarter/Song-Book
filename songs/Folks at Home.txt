[C]                     [F]                [C]
Well I wonder how the old folks are at home
[F]
I wonder if they miss me when I'm gone
[C]             [A7]
I wonder if they pray for the girl who went away
[D7]                           [G7]
And left her dear old parents so alone

[C]                       [F]             [C]
Now you can hear the cattle lowing in the lane
[F]
You can see the fields of blue grass where I roam
[C]               [A7]
You can almost hear them cry as they kiss their girl goodbye
[D7]             [G7]               [C]
I wonder how the old folks are at home

[F]                [C]
Just a village and a homestead on the farm
[F]
And a mother's love to shield you from all harm
[C]                     [A7]
The sky is bright and blue a sweetheart that loves you
[D7]                               [G7]
Just a village and a homestead on the farm

[F]             [C]
Now you can hear the cattle lowing in the lane
[F]
You can see the fields of blue grass where I roam
[C]               [A7]
You can almost hear them cry as they kiss their girl goodbye
[D7]             [G7]               [C]
I wonder how the old folks are at home
